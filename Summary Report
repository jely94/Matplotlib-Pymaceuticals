Summary
 Based on the summary statistics it appears that all the drug regimens were fairly symetric when comparing the mean and median of the tumor size data.  The Capomulin regimine had the second lowest variance and standard deviation that would suggest that the data for this trial is consistant.

Based on a sample of individual mice data included in the Capomulin regimen, it would appear that this drug did have a positive effect on lowering the size of the tumors in these mice.
